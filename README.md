An airport integration application that combines information for all departure and arrival flights can be a valuable tool for travellers, airport staff, and airlines. Such an application would provide real-time updates, streamline processes, and enhance overall efficiency. Here are some key features that could be included in an airport integration application:

1-	Flight Information: The application should provide comprehensive and up-to-date information about departure and arrival flights, including flight numbers, scheduled times, actual times, terminal/gate assignments, and any delays or cancellations. Users should be able to search for specific flights or view an overview of all flights.

2-	Notifications: The application should offer push notifications or alerts to keep users informed about any changes to their flights, such as gate changes, delays, or cancellations. These notifications can help passengers stay updated and make necessary adjustments to their travel plans.

3-	Check-in and Boarding Passes: Integration with airline systems would enable passengers to check-in for their flights, select seats, and receive digital boarding passes within the application. This feature would streamline the check-in process and reduce the need for physical documents.

4-	Baggage Information: The application could provide details about baggage allowances, restrictions, and tracking. Passengers can receive updates on the status of their checked-in baggage, ensuring they have the most current information.

5-	Wayfinding and Terminal Navigation: A map feature that guides passengers through the airport, highlighting key locations such as check-in counters, security checkpoints, lounges, and boarding gates. This would help passengers navigate complex airport layouts and reduce the chances of getting lost.

6-	Security Wait Times: Real-time information on security checkpoint wait times can help passengers plan their arrival at the airport accordingly, reducing stress and optimizing their time.

7-	Airport Services: Integration with airport services and amenities, such as parking availability, dining options, lounges, duty-free shopping, and transportation options, would enhance the overall passenger experience and provide convenient information.

8-	Transportation Updates: Integration with transportation providers like public transit systems or ride-sharing services would allow passengers to access real-time updates on routes, schedules, and any disruptions that may affect their travel to or from the airport.

9-	Accessibility Features: The application should consider accessibility features to accommodate passengers with disabilities or special needs. This can include features such as audio announcements, visual aids, and wheelchair-accessible routes.

10-	Language Support: The application should support multiple languages to cater to a diverse range of passengers, ensuring that information is accessible and easily understood.

Overall, an airport integration application that combines departure and arrival flight information, along with various other features, can greatly improve the travel experience for passengers and help streamline operations for airports and airlines.
